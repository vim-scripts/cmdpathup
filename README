This plugin provides a hotkey to go up by one level
when editing a file path on the vim command line.

Suppose you edit a file system path in the command line
where | represents the position of the cursor

:e ~/foo/bar/foo-bar/|barbar

Then pressing the plugin hotkey will result in

:e ~/foo/bar/|barbar

In contrast you would have to press <c-w> four times to
delete '/', 'bar', '-', and 'for' one by one.
